          The Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI) and the National Research Foundation (NRF), in partnership with the national Global Change Science Committee (GCSC) and the University of Mpumalanga (UMP), will host a four-day 6th National Global Change Conference, under the theme: Transformational Science for Social and Economic Empowerment in a Changing World. The conference will take place at the UMP campus in Mbombela from 01 – 04 December 2025.
          <br><br>
          Environmental threats and challenges still persist, despite our productive research efforts, and continue to plague our societies currently and most likely into the future. Adding complexity to these threats are devastating geopolitics, scramble for finite natural resources and desperate efforts by communities to access basic services.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Why should you attend?</strong>
          <br><br>
          We plan to gather as global change community to dissect and interrogate these challenges, learn from each other, establish new collaborations and devise new strategies and plans to address them. The 6th National Global Change Conference 2025 provides a platform for topical environmental issues to be discussed and to contribute to a sustainable future.
          Participants will be addressed by different speakers, including policy makers at various levels, captains of industry, researchers, and civil society, and be able to influence policy and planning decisions going forward.
          We look forward to robust discussions, interactive engagements and networking opportunities which the conference offers.

         <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.5;">
          “Global change” is a mature term, which has evolved as we learn more about the complex interactions within and among natural and human social and economic systems. Global change has taken on new meaning in 2025 as the world lurches into a new geopolitical era with decades-long post-World War II norms and assumptions upended. This revolution reminds us that all systems, both natural and human, are always in flux and that a steady state is a product of a set of drivers which themselves are subject to variation and flux. It also forces us to confront assumptions that we make even unwittingly. In fact, this year, the very fundaments of science, the believability of data and facts, are being challenged in ways that generations of researchers have ever had to confront. In this context, as global change researchers, must be able to show that the work we do it both relevant and impactful, in order to mount a robust defensive of our craft. More than ever before, we need to produce the data and evidence from our respective disciplines, and in addition we need to cooperate and learn to work better with researchers, practitioners, organizations and communities beyond our traditional set of collaborators.
         </p>
    <div id="welcomeHidden" style="display: none;">

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.5;">
        The pace of change is bewildering, not only geopolitically, but also in terms of technology. In the last year or two, Artificial Intelligence has exploded as both a concept and as a practice, placing new demands and pressures on us all, but also providing exciting new opportunities. Machine Learning and AI, like all emerging technologies, is not totally new (think buzzwords of last year such as blockchain, IoT and 4IR) and we have been using versions of this for decades – but a step change in its efficiency and accessibility has thrown up a massive dust cloud of data, tools, methods and ideas which we have to navigate our way through. For researchers, teacher and students, AI presented both improved efficiency (let AI do the heavy lifting) but also a thin line between original research and plagiarism. On the other hand, we can use AI to make sense of complex systems using algorithms that can recognize genuine patterns of variability in an instant.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300" style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.5;">
        Frustratingly, the environmental threats and challenges still persist, and despite our productive research efforts, continue to plague our societies currently and most likely into the future. The concept of Global Change incorporates a range of environmental trends, that also comprise a complex set of interacting challenges. That 2024 is now regarded as the warmest year on record, reminds us of the trajectory of climate change. In the last decade, the narrative around this has moved from “if and when”, to “where and how” is climate change manifesting. The drivers of global warming and climate change overlap with the challenges posed by land and water quality degradation, air pollution, food insecurity, biodiversity loss, waste and plastic pollution, marine resource over-exploitation, ozone layer depletion, urbanization, energy generation, and many other interconnected environmental issues which threaten our health and wellbeing in the broadest of terms. All these concerns, the new geopolitical era, the dawn if the AI world, and the continued threat of environmental degradation, are the basis of what we need to think about, to do and to stimulate our work. Research must produce knowledge, but not merely for knowledge’s sake – it must be useful, actionable and impactful. That does not negate the importance of 3 the notion of inquiry nor the development of disciplinary depth. While the challenges we face are indeed daunting, the opportunity for make a significant difference with the work we are doing has increased proportionately. South Africa (African and the globe) holds steadfastly to the idea that we can forge a path towards a sustainable future that is full of opportunities for innovation, resilience, new ways of doing business, and providing services. So, we plan to gather to contemplate these challenges, learn from each other, establish new collaborations and devise new plans. The 2025 Global Change Conference provides a venue for you to contribute to a sustainable future.

  <p class="call-abstract-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    This serves as the first call for abstracts for oral and poster presentations to be made at the conference. Guidelines for submitting an abstract are attached herewith for individuals who would like their scientific work to be considered for presentation at the conference. While the call is broad, preference will be given to registered post-graduate students and emerging researchers.
  </p>

  <p class="call-abstract-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.5;">
    The Global Change Research Plan (GCRP) remains the framework that guides funding and investment decisions in global change research in South Africa. Its four pillars — also known as knowledge challenges — will be used to ensure that accepted abstracts cover the entire scope of the plan.

    For oral and poster presentations, individuals are requested to submit a presentation title accompanied by a short abstract (less than 300 words) for pre-selection. Accepted abstracts from this phase will proceed to the second and final selection stage. In this final stage, presenters are expected to submit extended abstracts (up to 5 pages). Extended abstracts will be peer-reviewed and published in the conference Book of Abstracts. Abstracts may be submitted via email to
